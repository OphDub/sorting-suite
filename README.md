# Sorting-Suite

Project spec as assigned was to implement four fundamental following sorting algorithms:

- [Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
- [Insertion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/insertion_sort)
- [Merge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/merge_sort)
- [Quick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)

Each algorithm also required it's own tests which confirmed its validity and how large of an array each could handle
